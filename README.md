### HiðŸ‘‹ I'm Arlinda. 

## About me

Customer success expert turned full-stack dev with a passion for advocacy and accessibility. I've spent over a decade elevating the customer experience, so my transition into shaping user experiences with tech has been a natural transition.

When Iâ€™m not coding or writing, Iâ€™m probably hanging with my babies--my dog, Korbel and my cat, Harli--watching anime, or thinking about how to make technical documentation less boring.

Feel free to reach outâ€”I'm always up for cool projects and good conversation!
