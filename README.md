### HiðŸ‘‹ I'm Arlinda. 

## About me

**Customer success expert turned full-stack dev with a passion for advocacy and accessibility.**

After over a decade of elevating customer experiences, transitioning to shaping user experiences with technology felt like a natural evolution.

When Iâ€™m not coding or writing, Iâ€™m probably hanging with my babies--my dog, Korbel and my cat, Harli--watching anime, playing rugby or thinking about how to make technical documentation less boring.

Feel free to reach outâ€”I'm always up for cool projects and good conversation!
