## About me

**console.log("Hello World")🌍 I'm Arlinda😊**

After over a decade of elevating customer experiences, transitioning to shaping user experiences with technology felt like a natural evolution.

When I’m not coding, you can catch me:
📖 Writing my first novel: 
- I’m probably hanging with my babies--my dog, Korbel and my cat, Harli--watching anime, playing rugby or thinking about how to make technical documentation less boring.

Feel free to reach out—I'm always up for cool projects and good conversation!
