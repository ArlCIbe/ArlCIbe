### HiðŸ‘‹ I'm Arlinda. 

## About me

US Army vet turned full-stack dev with a passion for making tech more accessible. I've spent over a decade in customer success, but am now diving deep into code to build user-focused solutions.

When Iâ€™m not coding or writing, Iâ€™m probably hanging with my pets or thinking about how to make documentation less boring.

Feel free to reach out and connectâ€”always up for cool projects and good conversation!
