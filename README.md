### **A friendly note to whomever it may concern, but particularly to hiring managers, recruiters, and the like: please don’t let my playful tone fool you. I’m sharing my quirky side here, but if you’d prefer a more polished, buttoned-up version of my background, feel free to check out my LinkedIn or reach out directly.**

## Behind the Screen👩‍💻

After over a decade of crafting and elevating customer experiences by leveraging my natural ability to connect with others, transitioning into building and enhancing user experiences felt like the next logical step in my career and a necessary addition to my skill set. My passion for advocacy and accessibility is a direct extension of my commitment to leading *every* interaction—with customers, users, or otherwise—through empathy, and it is the guiding force behind the way I approach both development and life.

### Dev Essentials🧰
- Block schedule and timer to keep me on task✔️
- Furry co-wororkers to get me off task🐾
- Minimum of 3 beverages that you can't reach from your desk to get you up and moving💃; bonus point points if you have no earthly clue where you put them👍

## Beyond the Screen🚀

I am first, and foremost, a creative. And what I've come to know is that more than simply enjoying, or even loving, creating things, I feel compelled to do so. I'm almost always buzzing with some new idea or other, and not acting on those impulses can cause me to become full to bursting.
